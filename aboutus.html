    <div class="tagline overtext" font-size="17"> I am a rising junior this year, and I started to code from a coding class I took in seventh grade.
      I found that I was interested in the mindset of a coder. From there, I took two engineering classes in high school and learned about a whole new career path that intrigued me.
      I also participated in the Girls Who Code club at a local college as well as many other coding programs.
      Coding absolutely interests me, and I hope to incorporate it into my life or career in the future. Currently, I am considering majoring in Computer Science or
      chemical engineering since I have recently learned there are many technological options. Outside of computer science, I enjoy golfing with my school team, which gives me the skills of
      being a team leader and player. I believe the world is evolving quickly due to innovations to technology,
      and the easiest way to keep up is by being part of the creation. </div>

    <div class="tagline overtext" font-size="17"> I am a senior this upcoming school year.
        In school I was in underwater robotics club which introduced me to STEM concepts.
        After that I’ve been taking engineering classes.
        Even though I enjoyed engineering, I wanted to explore more of other STEM careers there are.
        In school I wasn’t exposed to computer science, so when a friend of mine did the program last year she taught me some of the basics.
        This made me realize that I wanted to learn more about what computer science has to offer.
        At the moment I am going to continue to develop my skills in both engineering and computer science in order to find a career
        that I’m passionate about and is involved in the STEM field. </div>

    <div class="tagline overtext" font-size="17"> I'm a senior living in Northwest Indiana, and I started coding my sophomore year after accidentally adding a computer science
      class to my schedule. I first started to love programming when we had to make an unbeatable game of ‘Tic-tac-toe’. I like the logical thought-process that coding involves,
      so I kept up with it! I plan to major in Computer Science or Cybersecurity, but in the meantime, I like playing lacrosse and spend too much time at the beach.
      I also really want to do a school bus demolition derby at my local fair at some point in my life, and I’ve had four hot chocolates today.</div>

I'm a rising senior in high school. I play soccer and love reading books on my free time.
I was introduced to computer science my freshman year of high school and have been interested since then.
Being part of girls who code taught me that even if you don’t know anything about the STEM field you can still make a change.
I want to get a career in the field of education and I hope to improve the way classrooms work.
I’m a strong believer that coding and education can come together and I aspire to make that happen.

    <div class="tagline overtext" font-size="17"> I have lived in Chicago all my life, and I will be a senior this fall.
        I love volunteering and playing tennis, and driving. I started coding this summer because I had never done it before, and I wanted to explore all of my options.
        Coding was interesting because it allowed you to explore your creativity, and completing a program or project was satisfying.
        For the future, I will go to college and study something in STEM,
        probably biology or chemistry, and hopefully after graduation will follow a career path involved in STEM, such as research or development. </div>
