  <title>The Impact on Workers</title>

  <center><h1>How Fast Fashion Affects Workers</h1></center>
  <p>
    Many companies, such as Forever 21, H&M, and Nordstrom's, use workers living in poverty in third-world countries, 80% of whom are women, to work as their slaves. They churn out
    clothes all day long for less than $1.00 every day. These women and children often have no other choice but to work in these factories, because they need to find a way
    to provide for their families.

  <p>
    Because the workers at these factories are desperate to provide for their families, workplace abuse is not considered as something important for factories to fix.
    In fact, the short-term contracts these factories use include a high risk for termination, especially if workers speak out against their superiors' or coworkers'
    abuse. Even if the woman speaks out against her abusers, she will become blacklisted at all the factories, and she won't be able to find work anywhere. Workers
    are pushed too hard, constantly working through their breaks and overtime with little or no pay. When they fail to meet these targets, workers may experience
    physical, verbal, and sexual violence as punishments.

  <h2>Statistics</h2>
  <p>
    1. 4% of what Australians spend on clothing goes to the wages of workers in garment factories across the globe
  </p>
  <p>
    2. Over 50% of workers within the fashion industry are not paid the minimum wage in countries like India and the Philippines
  </p>
  <p>
    3. In Pakistanâ€™s garment sector, 87% of women are paid less than the minimum wage
  </p>
  <p>
    4. In Australia, some garment outworkers earn as little as $7 an hour and, in some cases, as little as $4 well which is below the minimum wage of $17.49 per hour
